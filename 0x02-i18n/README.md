## Internationalization (i18n)

This Flask project supports internationalization (i18n) to cater to a multilingual audience. Using Flask-Babel, the application dynamically translates content based on user preferences or request headers. Translations are stored in `.po` files, and templates utilize the `gettext` function for localization. The locale can be inferred from URL parameters, user settings, or browser headers. Additionally, timestamps are localized to the user's timezone and preferred format, providing a seamless and inclusive user experience.
