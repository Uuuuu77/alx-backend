### Queuing System in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates a basic queuing system using Node.js and Redis. The system leverages the `kue` library to manage jobs asynchronously. Jobs are stored in Redis, allowing for robust job management and scheduling. This setup is ideal for handling tasks such as sending emails, processing data in batches, or managing background tasks in web applications. The integration with Redis ensures that jobs are reliably queued, processed, and monitored. This project serves as a starting point for implementing scalable and efficient task management solutions in JavaScript applications.
