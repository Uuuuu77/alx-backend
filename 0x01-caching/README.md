## Caching System Overview

A caching system is a high-speed data storage layer that temporarily stores copies of frequently accessed data. The primary purpose of caching is to enhance the performance and efficiency of data retrieval, reducing the time it takes to access data from the primary storage or database. Common caching strategies include FIFO (First-In-First-Out), LIFO (Last-In-First-Out), LRU (Least Recently Used), MRU (Most Recently Used), and LFU (Least Frequently Used), each defining different methods for evicting old data when the cache is full. While caching significantly improves system performance and scalability, it also introduces challenges such as managing storage capacity, ensuring data freshness, and maintaining consistency between the cache and the primary data source.
